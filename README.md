# jee-mains-marks-checker
the jee mains 2021 answer key was very annoying to check manually, so i made this script to automate this process

#how to use
paste the inputKey.txt and inputMy.txt files in the input folder containing the html code of your jee mains answer key page and your marked answers page respectively.
and run jeeMerge.py. out will be printed out as well as stored in the output folder.

tested only on jee mains 2021 1st attempt. should work on the rest as well.

#not working?
make an issue or try fixing it yourself.
