# jee-mains-marks-checker
the jee mains 2021 answer key was very annoying to check manually, so i made this script to automate this process

# how to use
1. Save HTML of ANSWER_CORRECTION_PAGE as inputKey.txt, inside input folder.

2. Save HTML of RESPONSE_SHEET as inputMy.txt inside input folder.
                    AND/OR (preferance given to the later)
    Save the text from the pdf of the final answer key in inputFinalKey.txt

3. run python jeeMerge.py

4. the printed output is also saved in the output folder


- tested only on jee mains 2021 1st attempt. should work on the rest as well.

# not working?
make an issue or try fixing it yourself.
im new to this coding stuff so theres a lot of spaghetti code
